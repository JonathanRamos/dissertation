\begin{abstract}
  Laplacian eigenmaps and diffusion maps are two well known
  dimensionality reduction techniques. We studied these two techniques
  as embedding of distances on graphs. We present a result that shows
  that the two techniques are closely related, i.e., that one is an
  anisotropic scaling of the other, in the case where the graph is
  undirected and that the relationship breaks down when the graph is
  directed.
