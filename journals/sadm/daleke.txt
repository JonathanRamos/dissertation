Dear David,

I am writing this email on the behalf of Minh Tang, my advisee in the
School of Informatics and Computing, to request the
waiving of the six months requirement from the time of nomination of
his research committee to the time of his dissertation defence. 
Minh had originally planned to defend his dissertation this past
August, but he made a mistake in counting his credits hours. Because
two of his credits were not graduate level credits, he had not amassed
the required 90 credits hours to graduate. Thus, even though he had
submitted his nomination to candidacy and 
nomination of research committee forms to the University Graduate
School since October 2009, the forms were not approved. Now that his
issue with the credits requirement had
been taken care of, and his nomination to candidacy and nomination of
research committee forms are approved, Minh is planning to defend his
dissertation this coming October. I believe that he is ready to defend his
dissertation, and thus I would like to request on his behalf that you
allow him to waive the six months requirement.
