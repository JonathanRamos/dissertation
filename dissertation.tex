\begin{acknowledgements}
  It had been a long and sometimes difficult road towards the
  completion of this dissertation. I would like to express my thanks
  to all the people who had made this possible. \\ \\
%
  \noindent I owed my deepest gratitude to my advisor, Prof.~Michael
  W.  Trosset. I met Michael during an important junction of my
  graduate studies when I was lost in my search for a research
  direction.  Michael imparted on me the penchant for clarity of
  thoughts and expression. His kindness and patience had made the
  process of completing this dissertation a much more enjoyable and
  enlightening experience. With high probability, I am indebted to him
  more than I
  realized. \\ \\
%
  \noindent I would like to express my gratitue to my co-advisor,
  Prof.~Dirk van Gucht. I am grateful to Dirk for the many hours of
  discussion on various topics, from data mining to
  uncertainty. Dirk's guidance during the early stages of my graduate
  studies was crucial in
  inspiring me to do research. \\ \\
%
  \noindent I had received a lot of help and support from Prof.~Paul
  W. Purdom and Prof.~David Leake. Paul's book was one of my first
  source in learning about analysis of algorithms. Both Paul and David
  had supervised my independent studies and I thank them for their
  guidance and feedback to my semidemihemi-baked ideas. \\ \\
%
  \noindent I would like to thank Dana Fielding for her words of
  encouragement as well as helping me with the paperworks. In
  particular, Dana extricated me from the mess caused by my failure to
  signed up for the required number of credits. I imagine it must have
  been as difficult as pulling a hippopotamus from a marsh. I would
  also like to thank
  Debbie Norris for her help in that incident. \\ \\
%
  \noindent I am indebted to Prof.~Carey E. Priebe for his influences
  in various aspects of this work. It was the discussions between Carey
  and Michael that motivated a large part of this dissertation. My
  work was funded by grants where Carey and Michael are the principal investigators. \\
  \\
%
  \noindent I am grateful to Prof.~Amol Mali and Prof.~Christine Cheng
  from the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. Amol guided me through
  my masters program. Christine introduced me to combinatorics and
  mathematical rigour through her lectures on graphs algorithms. \\ \\
%
  \noindent I have had the pleasure of knowing a lot of nice people
  during my years at IU\@. Special thanks to Brent Castle and Michel
  Salim for the interesting and fun discussions on various topics. I
  thank Aaron Jones, Bill Butske, Bledar Doraci, Carlos Castro, Darius
  Strapoc, Grigor Khatchatryan, Huy Vo, Kerry Krutilla, Mikhail
  Gorshteyn, Paul Kanczuzewski, Snea Thinsan, Van Ly, and Wael Abu
  Shammala for the laughers and fun during the time spent chasing the
  soccer ball together. \\ \\
%
  \noindent Finally, I would like to thank my parents for their love
  and constant support. Without them, all my successes would be for
  naught. \\ \\

  \noindent The research described herein was supported by a grant
  from the Office of Naval Research and by a subcontract to Carey
  E. Priebe's National Security Science \& Engineering Faculty
  Fellowship.

\begin{abstract}
  Since the introduction of Isomap
  \cite{tenebaum00:_global_geomet_framew_nonlin_dimen_reduc} and
  Locally Linear Embedding \cite{roweis00:_nonlin} in 2000, there has
  been an explosion of interest in techniques for nonlinear dimension
  reduction.  We present a framework that unifies several prominent
  techniques, notably diffusion maps and (one approach to) Laplacian
  eigenmaps.  Our framework relies on the construction of various
  Euclidean distances on undirected graphs and the subsequent
  embedding of these distances in various Euclidean spaces.  We also
  consider how to construct and embed Euclidean distances on directed
  graphs.
